<h1>The Alchemist</h1>
<h3>by Paulo Coelho</h3>
<p><em>It was difficult</em> not to think about what he had left behind. The desert, with its endless monotony, put him to dreaming. The boy could still see the palm trees, the wells, and the face of the woman he loved. He could see the Englishman at his experiments, and the camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it. Maybe the alchemist has never been in love,<a href="https://archive.org/stream/thealchemist_201908?ref=ol#page/n93/mode/2up"> the boy thought.</a></p>

<a href="page_two.html"><h1>... He saw that Fatima's eyes were filled with tears.</h1></a>

<p><em>If what one finds is made of pure matter, it will never spoil</em> And one can always come back. If what you had found was only a moment of light like the explosion of a star, you would find nothing on your return</p>
